# Message Vault

Message Vault pulls conversations out of chat apps and stores them in a
self-hosted, searchable vault. This file is the glossary: the words we use
for things in the product, and the words we have decided not to use. It
holds no implementation details.

## Language

### Collections in the sidebar

Three concepts sit next to each other in the sidebar and are easy to
confuse. They are distinguished by what they collect and by whether
membership is explicit or computed.

**Contact Group**:
A named collection of contacts, referenced from a search so a query can
name a set of people without listing them.
_Avoid_: Group, Label, Contact List

**Saved Search**:
A named query, stored so it can be run again. It collects nothing and
holds no members; the same saved search returns different results as
messages arrive.
_Avoid_: Saved Group, Smart Group, Filter

**Message Tag**:
A name marked onto conversations. Membership is explicit, which is what
separates it from a Saved Search; it marks conversations rather than
people, which is what separates it from a Contact Group.
_Avoid_: Thread Tag, Conversation Tag, Label

### The archive

**Conversation**:
One exchange with one person or group, holding its messages and
participants. It is the unit the product acts on: tagging, trashing, and
searching all resolve to whole conversations even where the interface
speaks of messages.
_Avoid_: Thread, Chat

**Import Run**:
One attempt to bring messages from a backup into the vault, recorded
permanently whether it succeeded, failed, or was cancelled. The record
belongs to the account and cannot be deleted by the person; anything in
the interface that merely points at a run is a shortcut and can be.
_Avoid_: Import Job, Push

**Vault**:
One installation's store of accounts and their messages. A vault holds
many accounts, and each account's data is isolated from the others.
_Avoid_: Database, Instance, Server
